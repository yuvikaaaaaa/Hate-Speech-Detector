# Hate Speech Detector

ML system to detect hate speech in text using NLP and Machine Learning.

## Features
- Text preprocessing with NLTK
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest)
- Real-time detection via Streamlit

## Live Demo
[Deploying to Streamlit Cloud - Link coming soon]

Â§ Hate Speech Detector (Live Demo | GitHub)
- Built NLP-based text classification system using Python to detect hate speech 
  achieving 85%+ accuracy on labeled tweet dataset
- Implemented text preprocessing pipeline (tokenization, lemmatization) and 
  TF-IDF vectorization with bigram features
- Trained and compared 3 ML models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random 
  Forest) selecting best performer
- Deployed interactive Streamlit web application with real-time prediction and 
  confidence scoring
